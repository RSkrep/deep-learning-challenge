# deep-learning-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the success of charities. Utilizing deep learning techniques, three machine learning models were created, with the final model achieving an accuracy score greater than 75%. Each iteration of the model was adjusted slightly to optimize its performance and provide the best predictive tool.

First we needed to load a csv file of charity data and process the information.

Secondly we needed to create and train a deep learning model to analyze the success of future charities.

Thirdly, we needed to optamize the model to reach a accuracy above 75% by changing and reporcessing the data or by altering the neurons and hidden layer.

Lasly, We were required to write and analysis on our findings and the ways in which we altered the original deep learning model and information to get a accuracy level greater than 75%. This section of the project is located in the 3rd model reated labled AlphabetSoupCharity_Organization2. As it took two attempts to recreate the model into on with an accuracy greater than 75%
